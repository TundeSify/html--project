            Animation is the process of creating the illusion of movement by displaying a sequence of drawings, paintings, or computer-generated images. In its simplest form, animation brings still images to life through a series of frames shown in rapid succession.
        </p>
        <p>
            In anime, which refers to Japanese animated productions, animation involves various artistic and technical steps, blending traditional hand-drawn techniques with modern digital technologies.

        | Key Elements of Animation in Anime |
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
        <ol>
            <li>Frame Rate: <p>Anime often uses a lower frame rate than Western animations, typically 8–12 frames per second. This gives anime its distinct “choppy” feel compared to smoother animations like those from Disney or Pixar. However, in key action scenes, studios may increase the frame rate to enhance fluidity.</p></li>
            <hr>
            <li>Keyframes and In-Betweens: <p>Keyframes: These are crucial frames that represent major points of movement (e.g., the beginning and end of a character's punch).</p><p>In-Betweens: Intermediate frames between keyframes create the illusion of smooth motion. In anime, less focus is often placed on in-betweens, favoring more expressive keyframes.</p></li>
            <hr>
            <li>Sakuga: <p>“Sakuga” refers to moments in anime where the animation quality is significantly heightened, often for dramatic or action-heavy scenes. These scenes feature smooth and detailed movement, making them stand out from the rest of the episode or film.</p></li>

        | Traditional vs. Digital Animation |
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
        <ol>
            <li>Traditional Animation: <p> Many classic anime (like Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion) were made using hand-drawn cels. Artists drew each frame by hand, which required significant time and labor.</p></li> <hr>
            <li>Digital Animation: <p>Modern anime studios now use software such as Toon Boom or Adobe Animate for parts of the animation process. Digital methods speed up production while allowing for effects like motion blur, lighting, and 3D integration.</p></li>

        |  Use of 3D and CGI in Anime |
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
            <p> In recent years, studios have incorporated 3D models and CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) to complement hand-drawn elements.</p> 
            <p>Series like Beastars and Land of the Lustrous heavily rely on 3D animation, while other shows, like Attack on Titan, mix CGI with traditional animation to depict large-scale battles or intricate backgrounds.</p>

        | Animation Techniques Common in Anime |
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
        <ol>
            <li>Limited Animation: <p> Anime often uses limited animation, where only small parts of the frame move (e.g., the character’s mouth during dialogue). This technique reduces production costs while still conveying meaning effectively.</p></li> <hr>
            <li>Looping Animation: <p>Reusing short sequences, such as a character running, is a common technique to save time. Backgrounds might scroll repeatedly to simulate long movements.</p></li> <hr>
            <li>Exaggerated Effects: <p>Anime makes heavy use of exaggerated visual effects, such as speed lines during fast movement or glowing eyes during moments of intense emotion. These effects heighten the storytelling impact and emotional engagement.

        | Challenges in Anime Production |
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
        <p>
            Anime production is known for its demanding schedules and long hours. Tight deadlines often result in outsourcing parts of the animation process to other studios or countries. Additionally, maintaining high-quality animation on a budget is a constant challenge, which is why only select scenes (like sakuga) feature extraordinary animation.

    <hr>
    <div class="bullets">
        <p>
            In anime, animation is not just a medium to create movement—it enhances emotional storytelling. A character’s subtle change in expression, the timing of an exaggerated punch, or a beautiful, slow-moving background scene can evoke emotions that resonate deeply with viewers.
